You are working for a TV program and you are asked to develop a script able to automatically detect people faces inside of an image and pixelate them in order to protect their identity. Although this could be achieved using many different methods, you decided to detected faces using color segmentation and morphological operations. The main idea is to use segmentation in the HSV color space in order to detect skin regions inside the image and then use morphological operations in order to detect face shaped areas. In order to perform the first task (skin segmentation) you need to estimate how the skin colors are distributed inside the HSV color space. In order to obtain this information, you can use a small database of 100 32x32 color face images that can be extracted from the compressed file facesdb.zip.
